<h1>About Me</h1>

<img src="../headshot.jpg" alt="Sofia Headshot" width="300">

<p>
I’m Sofia Kissel, a fashion and culture journalist studying at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications.
My work explores how style intersects with identity, sustainability, beauty culture, and the systems that shape
what we wear.
</p>

<p>
I specialize in editorial storytelling, service journalism, and data-driven reporting. I'm building a portfolio
that includes written stories, multimedia reporting, and digital projects.
</p>

<p>
My goal is to work in fashion media, creative direction, or editorial strategy. I'm learning how to take real
reporting, data analysis, and trend forecasting — and turn it into stories people want to read.
